**Note about custom spoilers:**  
`custom_spoiler` describes the number of custom spoilers that exist for the specified board. If the number is `4`, it means that you can choose anywhere from 1 to 4.
For our imageboard pages, the custom spoiler images changes every time a new post is made. If you are writing a browser add-on with auto-update
functionality, you should first check the HTML to see if a custom spoiler has been posted, and use the same number, so when new spoiler posts come in, they match the pre-existing ones.
If there are no custom spoilers already in a thread, you can just random whatever you'd like, since there is no need to match pre-existing ones.
